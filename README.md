## Description
My motivation for this project was to continue my ventures into a full MVC-based stack by incorporating a template engine called Handlebars.js as the "views" component.
I decided to build a simple blog app because it's a straightforward way to demonstrate the power of templating engines, routing and database operations.
This project essentially would solve the issue of finding a space where thoughts - namely those involving programming - can be jotted down and saved to a user's account, then displayed for those visiting the site in the future.
In building this small app I learned the benefits of using a template engine (handlebars.js), and I also furthered my understanding of the MVC paradigm, of course referring to the model-view-controller state and how, though modular, they complement each other and come together to produce fluid web applications.
